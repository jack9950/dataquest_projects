- Start by writing a paragraph in a markdown cell introducing the project and the dataset.
- Import the pandas and NumPy libraries
- Read the autos.csv CSV file into pandas, and assign it to the variable name autos.
    - Try without specifying any encoding (which will default to UTF-8)
    - If you get an encoding error, try the next two most popular encodings (Latin-1 and Windows-1252) until you are able to read the file without error.
- Create a new cell with just the variable autos and run this cell.
    - A neat feature of jupyter notebook is its ability to render the first few and last few values of any pandas object.
- Use the DataFrame.info() and DataFrame.head() methods to print information about the autos dataframe, as well as the first few rows.
    - Write a markdown cell briefly describing your observations.


- Use the DataFrame.columns attribute to print an array of the existing column names.
- Copy that array and make the following edits to columns names:
  - yearOfRegistration to registration_year
  - monthOfRegistration to registration_month
  - notRepairedDamage to unrepaired_damage
  - dateCreated to ad_created
  - The rest of the column names from camelcase to snakecase.
- Assign the modified column names back to the DataFrame.columns attribute.
- Use DataFrame.head() to look at the current state of the autos dataframe.
- Write a markdown cell explaining the changes you made and why.
