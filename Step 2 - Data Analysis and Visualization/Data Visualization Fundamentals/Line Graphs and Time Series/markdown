The dataset contains data from January 4 until July 31. Each row describes the COVID-19 report for one day in one specific country (the first few rows show only China because the virus was only present in China at that time).

For each row, we have the following data points:

`Date_reported`: The date when the data was reported in year-month-day format.
`Country`: The country to which the report corresponds.
`New_cases`: The number of new cases reported for that date and for that country.
`Cumulative_cases`: The number of total cases up to that date in that country.
`New_deaths`: The number of new deaths reported for that date and for that country.
`Cumulative_deaths`: The number of total deaths up to that day in that country.

The rows in our dataset are listed in time order, starting with January 4 and ending with July 31. We call a series of data points that is listed in time order a time series.

Typically we visualize time series with line graphs. The time values are always plotted, by convention, on the x-axis.

Let's read in our dataset in the following exercise.
