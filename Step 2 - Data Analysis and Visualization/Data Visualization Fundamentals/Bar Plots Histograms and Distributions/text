1. Generate a scatter plot with the workingday column on the x-axis and the casual column on the y-axis. Add 'Working Day Vs. Casual' as a title.
2. Generate a scatter plot with the workingday column on the x-axis and the registered column on the y-axis. Add 'Working Day Vs. Registered' as a title. You'll first need to close the previous scatter plot using plt.show()
3. Do you notice an opposing pattern between the two scatter plots? The scatter plots might look a bit odd at first, but recall workingday only has two unique values, so you'll see two narrow vertical strips on the plots.


We've already saved the table above into the weekday_averages variable, which is a DataFrame (you can see the code we used in the code editor).

    Generate a bar plot using the weekday_averages variable:
        The weekday column provides the x-coordinates.
        The registered column provides the heights.

    Change the x-tick labels using the plt.xticks() function.
        The new labels should be ['Sunday', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday'].
        The x-coordinates of the labels are [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
        All labels are rotated to an angle of 30 degrees.

    Analyze the bar plot in light of our initial observations â€” does the results support the idea that registered users rent more bikes on working days?
