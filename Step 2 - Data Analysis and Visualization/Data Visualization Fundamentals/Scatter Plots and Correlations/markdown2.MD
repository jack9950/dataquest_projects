1. Plot two line graphs sharing the same x- and y-axis.
 - For the first graph, plot the dteday column on the x-axis and the casual column on the y-axis.
 - For the second graph, plot dteday on the x-axis and registered on the y-axis.
2. Rotate the x-ticks to an angle of 30 degrees using plt.xticks().
3. Add the label 'Bikes Rented' to the y-axis using plt.ylabel().
4. Add the label 'Date' to the x-axis using plt.xlabel().
5. Add the title 'Bikes Rented: Casual vs. Registered' using plt.title().
6. Add a legend using plt.legend(). Use 'Casual' and 'Registered' as labels.
7. What differences and similarities do you see for the two line graphs?

Evaluate the following sentences.

1. The worse the weather, the higher the encoding number in the weathersit column. Assign True or False to sentence_1.
2. The correlation between weathersit and cnt is -0.30 — this means that as the weather gets worse, the number of bike rentals tends to decrease. Assign True or False to sentence_2.
3. The correlation between weathersit and hum is +0.59 — this means that as the humidity decreases, the weather tends to get better. Assign True or False to sentence_3.


In this lesson, we continued our discussion about exploratory data visualization and learned about the following:

- Seasonal trends and how to identify them using line graphs.
- Scatter plots and how to generate one using Matplotlib.
- How to visualize correlations using scatter plots.
- How to measure correlation using Pearson's r.
- How to interpret correlation values correctly.

In the next lesson, we'll learn about frequency distributions, bar plots, and histograms.
